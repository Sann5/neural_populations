# neural_populations
Repository for semester project at The Cortical Computation Group, INI, UZH/ETH, modeling neural populations.

## TODO
- Get the code started (from the IML 2021 demos?)
	- Eventually you will get the problem of having a shit ton of neurons and few data points, we will see what happend. 
	- When there rmember to se `scikitlearn` documentation regardin the degeneracy (perhaps it is the same degeneracy that Krause mentioned in the IML lecutres).
