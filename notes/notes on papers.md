## A method to add Gaussian mixture models.
- We deslike the fact that one needs to do apprently complex operations to obtain the summed GMM. In this specific case it is, concatenate, simplify and select. Its not clear how the brain would performsuch computations. In the other hand the Vector quantization algorithm seems to be well within the limits of what a toy model of a neural network with Hebbian learning can achive.
