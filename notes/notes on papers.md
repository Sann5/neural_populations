## A method to add Gaussian mixture models.
- We deslike the fact that one needs to do apprently complex operations to obtain the GMM. In this specific case it is, concatenate, simplify and select. Its not clear how the brain would performsuch computations. In the other hand the Vector quantization algorithm seems to be well within the limits of what Hebbian learning can provide.
