We then show how by assuming sperichal varainces and uniform wights the Hard EM algorithm becomes one and the same with the K-means algorithm. Then we show how K-means can be seen as an istance of a Winner Takes it All (WTA) artificial neural network (ANN). \n",

However, the Hard EM will greedly assign a data point to one of the cluster even thou the probability that it belongs to either of them is the same or almost the same. This may lead to poor performance specially when the clusters are overlaping. By using membership intead of hard assignments we account for this uncertainty and also help poorly intialized clusters to get updated, since even if they are far away from data points, will still have a responsability over them."

Furthermore, by discretising the activation of the output neurons in this toy biological circuit, such thay only one neuron gets activated given an input, one can recover the previously described WTA ANN, and thereby an online version of the K-means algorithm. The winning neuron will therefore be the only one to adjuste the weights of the corresponding synapses, thereby makeing it more likely that upon a similar input the same output neuron will fire. It is important to note that in such a biological system the update of the weight happens locally, in the sens that if neuron $y_m$ is activated the weight $w_{nm}$ will be strengthened through Hebbian learining if there was an input from neuron $n$ (e.g the presynaptic neuron fires shortly before the postsynaptic neuron). Even thou previosuly we considered all $w_{:m}$ weight associated with neuron $y_m$ to be updated as a whole in a vector form, we can also think of the update takeing place individually for each element of $w_{n:m}$, asciated with input neuron $x_n$ and output neuron $y_m$.\n",

    "In general it might be useful to reason about learning in the brain as an unsupervised learnign procedure, where labels are stimuly which generate specific input pattern distributions that the barin then categorizes as belonging to the unldeying stimuly by tuning the weights of the synapses (cite_here). Then it is natural to think of these undelying stimuly as hidden random variables, with the observed data being the patterns that they generate. Thinking about the system at hand in this temrs make the EM algorithm natural tool to perofrm inference."
