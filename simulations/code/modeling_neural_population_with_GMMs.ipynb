    "The present work explores how one can model learning in neural populations as an insatnce of online Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) learning. First we descirbe the Hard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, a common method to infere GMM's. We then show how by assuming sperichal varainces and uniform wights the Hard EM algorithm becomes one and the same with the K-means algorithm. Then we show how K-means can be seen as an istance of a Winner Takes it All (WTA) artificial neural network (ANN). \n",

    "WTA-ANNs are 2 layered, fully conected ANNs where only one output neuron $z_j$ (we will refere to any of the $K$ neurons in the output layer as neuron $z_j$) is be activated per input. Learning takes place through Hebbian adjustments of the weights $\\Lambda$ between these two layers every time an input is presented to the network. Only the weights $\\lambda_{j:}$ (the row vectors of matrix $\\Lambda$) associated with the winning output neuron $z_j$ are adjusted per input, the winning neuron being the one with weights $\\lambda_{j:}$ that are the closest, accoridng to some messure of distance, to the $n^{th}$ input vector $^nx$, however when its not important to indicate the index of the data poin $x$ will be used.

The idea is that given an input pattern $^nx$, the asociated weights $\\lambda_{j:}$ of winning neuron $z_j$ gets adjusted such that, if the same or a similar input $^{n+1}x$ is presented to the network then $z_j$ is again the winner, thereby succesfully classifying the input.

Here we call this issue uneaven membership assignment. This is partly due to the \"hardness\" of the asignment step, or in other words the fact that only one neuron can win and therefore represent a given input. By modeling centroids as being only partly responsable for a given data point, instead of belonging exlusively to one, we can somewhat bypass this problem, although not entierly since the performance of the algorithm will sitll be highly dependent on initialization.\n",

    "The idea is that by showing that a WTA is equivalent to an online version of the EM algorithm we also show that it shares the same thoretical assurances, namely that algorithm monotonically increases the lower bound of the likelihood. But perhaps even more importantly, it gives us a probabilistic framework which we can use to reason about the lerning (at this point we will use about mixtures, components and neurons interchangebly). \n",

Here we propose that such probability can be seen as the homeostatic neuronal activity of the output neurons, e.g. the probability that a neuron will get activated. While our model does not learn this parameters as it is unclear how their update could be incorporated into the model, one can set them a priori as hyperparameters, and see how they affect the learning, for example seting them to follow a log normal distribution whicha has been observed experimentally (TODO: cite paper on log dist of activities).\n",

This is interesting because it seems that this quantity could be similar in nature to the normalized activity of neurn $j$ in the outout layer, which is something that is accesible in the WTA-ANN framework. In a biological context it would be natural that the intensity with which the output neuron reacts to a stimuly affects the strenght of the learning, that is the magnitude of the change in the synaptic weights (TODO: reference equation). With this in mind it might make sense to think of the mixing weights as the homsteatic activity level of output neuron $z_j$, that they are taken into account for the computation of its normalized reaction to an input $\\gamma_j(^nx)$ (note that the mixing weights are only present in the computation of the $\\gamma_j(^nx)$).  \n",

    "Naturally this normalized activity $\\gamma_j(^nx)$ is where the lateral inhibiton of the ouput neurons comes in, such that the overall activity is a function of the activity of all of the nuerons in the output layer. This division operation could be implemented approximately with shunting inhibition of example, where the other neurons in the output layer set the conducntance such that the gain and the sumation dynamics of nenuon $z_j$ are is determined by the activity of all other neurons (TODO: cite divisin papaer here). This is due to the fact that the output volatege of a postsynaptioc neuron can be modeled as being inversly porportional to the conductance (set by lateral shuntting inhibition) and directly proportional to the driving current resulting from the temporal and spatial sumation of inhibitory and exitatory inputs comming from the input layer. Alternative ways of activity normalization have been proposed including synaptic sacleing and feedforward inhibition (TODO: cite paper on this things). It is not clear how exactly a biological circuit would implement exactly the operation for the updates of $\\gamma_j(^nx)$.\n",

    "We further note that the proposed version of this algorithm computes consists only of comuting the nromalized output of each neuron and then updateing the synaptic weights, which as you can see from (TODO reference espression fo update) only involves the quanitites that are local to the synapse. \n",
