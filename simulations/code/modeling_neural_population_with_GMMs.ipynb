    "The present work explores how one can model learning in neural populations as an insatnce of online Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) learning. First we descirbe the Hard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, a common method to infere GMM's. We then show how by assuming sperichal varainces and uniform wights the Hard EM algorithm becomes one and the same with the K-means algorithm. Then we show how K-means can be seen as an istance of a Winner Takes it All (WTA) artificial neural network (ANN). \n",

This is referred to as parameter estimation.

    "How can this responsability be computed locally in our ANN model? We can view it as the normalized output of neuron $y_m$. By nature the normalization opertaion necesitates a division which takes as input the other non-nromalized activations of the other neruons. Naturally this is where the lateral inhibiton of the ouput neurons comes in, such that the overall activity is a function to the activity of all of the nuerons in the output layer. This division operation could be implemented with shunting inhibition of example, where the other neurons in the output layer set the conducntance such that the gain and the sumation dynamics of nenuon $y_m$ are is determined by the activity of all other neurons. This is due to the fact that the volatege of a postsynaptioc neuron can be modeled as being inversly porportional to the conductance (set by lateral shuntting inhibition) and directly proportional to the driving current resulting from the temporal and saptial sumation of inhibitory and exitatory inputs comming from the input layer. \n",

The assumtions might not hold generally in which case the overall operation might only approximate division but we just wanted to point out that such division operations are possible with well known mechanisms in biological neurons (cite_here).
